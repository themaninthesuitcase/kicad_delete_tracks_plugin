# Nuke Tracks KiCad Plugin

Maybe you've made a right mess of things and want to start over? Or maybe you're using the [auto router plugin](https://github.com/random-builder/kicad_freerouting-plugin) and want to make sure random junk isn't going to ruin things.

You could run the menu command to delete all non-locked tracks then refill the zones. Or you could push this 1 button which is just easier and faster.

This plugin will nuke all tracks that are not locked on the board<sup>*</sup> then automatically regenerates any zones. 

Have regrets? A single undo will put it back to how it was before the plugin ran.

\* By not deleting locked tracks you can choose to keep anything you're happy with and have locked.
